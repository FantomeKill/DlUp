### **TESTED AND MADE ON LINUX AND WINDOWS.

This node project allow you to upload and download file from a server.

It probably not the best solution but it work. If you want to help I'll be super happy to accept.

-------------

#### How to use it :

run these commands
```sh
npm install
node app.js
```
I recommend using nodemon

#### Settings you can change :

change in the code the information you want
```javascript
const port = 25582;
```

Now the server is open with the port you want (in the example it is 25582) at you ip or server's ip.
in the file uploads it is the file that you've uploaded and in the download file it is the file that you can download from your server
